* process_poll() should be renamed - its "timeout" parameter is not
  really consistent with the idea of poll() because it means "wait
  until the child exits"
* add close_input() function to close the write end of the stdin
  pipe and sent the child a signal to exit
* handle differing new-line characters
* add parameters to spawn_process: stdin, stdout, stderr; enable
  string-based input, output to /dev/null (Linux) or nul (Windows);
  redirecting stderr to stdout
* enable a single wait on both stdout and stderr
* see how tools::pskill can be used our own process_send_signal
